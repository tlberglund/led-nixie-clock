# LED Strip Driver

A [Raspberry Pi Pico W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) project based on [the FreeRTOS LWIP stack](https://github.com/tlberglund/pico-freertos-lwip).

The project receives LED instructions over HTTP, decodes them, and sends them to a string of APA102 LEDs using custom PIO code.

That doesn't explain much, but hey, the project isn't done yet. Better docs to follow.
