# LED Nixie Clock

A [Raspberry Pi Pico2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) project based on [the FreeRTOS LWIP stack](https://github.com/tlberglund/pico-freertos-lwip).

The project gets its time from an NTP server, then drives a set of APA102 LEDs on a custom board to create an effect inspired by old-style nixie tubes.

That doesn't explain much, but hey, the project isn't done yet. Better docs to follow.
